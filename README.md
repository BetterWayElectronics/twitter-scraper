## Userscript for Scraping Twitter Replies

**Twitter-Scraper** is a client-side userscript designed for efficiently scraping all replies from a specific Twitter user. The script automatically scrolls through the user's reply history, capturing and storing their posts. Once all replies have been collected, it prompts you to save the data as a text file for further analysis or archival purposes.
